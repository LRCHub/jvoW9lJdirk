There's been an accident (calm down)
There's been an accident
Breathe in and out, calm down (In and out, calm down)
In and out, calm down (In and out, calm down)

We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't

Breathe in and out, calm down

But would you do it again, again and count backwards from ten?
(I cannot make those mistakes, no)
Sometimes I swear I can see straight through you
Just concentrate, control
(But would you do it again?)

We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, (oh, come on)
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back

(Murder, oh murder, oh where have you been?)

We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't (We can't go back...)
We can't go back, can't go back (...to anything, anything)
Anything, anything...
