Living with you is trial and error
Admiring the view I sit astonished
Trying to avoid each other
Is this were it ends a final conflict
A room with a view beneath the covers
Learning to avoid each other
You left me sore frayed at the edges
Becoming a feat of sheer duration
A simple lunge became our failure

I used to stay here all the time
Watching your feelings pass me by

Living apart is tried and tested
Nothing today of being swept in
Stretching out my palms to save you
Travelling alone has left you bitter
Trying not to spoil your shoes
Vanity revealed im smothered

I used to stay here all the time
Watching your feelings pass me by
I hardly ever lose control
And I never meant to make you cry

There will never be a transformation
There are always flaws in my navigation
Plotted out a course devoid of reason
Living on your own you hide your feelings

I used to stay here all the time,
Watching your feelings pass me by,
I hardly ever lose control,
And I never meant to make you cry
